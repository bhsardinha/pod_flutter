some details: the reverb doesnt need level knob. its the reverb level knob on the main knob section on the main screen.\  
  2 - i want to create a specific visual item for this section, resembling the lcd virtual knobs of the real Pod Xt/Xt Pro: 
  use my @lib/ui/widgets/dot_matrix_lcd.dart as base and create a 3 line screen where on top is the label, in center the    
  orange pixelated LCD-y (interactive) knob, on bottom the current value. beautiful as the old lcd on the pod. with a       
  orange marker on the active parameter (and inverted font color) as the pod does). plan this, and adapt the
