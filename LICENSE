ADDITIONAL NOTES:

This project implements the Line 6 POD XT Pro MIDI protocol based on analysis
of the pod-ui reference implementation (https://github.com/arteme/pod-ui),
which is licensed under GPL v3.

While this implementation is an independent work written in a different
language (Dart/Flutter vs Rust) and does not contain copied code from pod-ui,
it was developed with knowledge gained from studying pod-ui's protocol
implementation.

The MIT license applies to the original code in this repository. Users should
be aware of pod-ui's GPL v3 license when considering the relationship between
these projects.
